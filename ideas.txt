Okay, it works! How to build it?

Do I use a MVC approach.  Because it is more of an "App" than a game.
There is not a lot of movement.  If each game object is a DIV, then I get
a lot of phone compatibility for free (ie touch).

I'm not thinking of using CSS really.  But this isn't a performance intensive thing.

Also, I may want the AI to be written server side, so I can swap it out

Moving things generally, is much easier on canvas.

I'm going with canvas, because why not.

Should I make a node webkit version with multiplayer?

If this is multiplayer, how will it work?  Where does each code go?


If this is going to be multiplayer.  The clients should be dumb.  They just receive the other ships state.


//client
fire.onclick = function(){
	socket.emit('move', 'F')
}

//client view
socket.on('move', function(newMe,newOther){
  newMe.health > me.health && damageAnimation()
})
